# PyBer_Analysis

## Analysis Overview

The purpose of this analysis to provide the CEO of Pyber ride-sharing data by city type so she can make informed business decisions.  This analysis includes a table summarizing ride-sharing data from January 2019 though the first part of May 2019 as well as a line chart showing the total fare over time.

## Results

### Table Summarizing Ride-Sharing Data

The above table shows that while the total rides, drivers and fares are highest for urban cities, the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver are lowest in urban cities.  Also, while rural cities have the lowest total rides, drivers and fares, the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver are the highest among the three city types.  As expected, data for suburban cities falls in between across the board.

### Chart of Total Fare by City Type

The chart above supports what was seen in the summary table where urban cities have the highest amount of total fares, rural cities have the lowest total fares, and suburban cities’ total fares fall in between those for urban and those for rural cities.

## Summary

Based on the above results, we have the following business recommendations:

1. Increase the fare for ride sharing in both suburban and urban cities to bring up the average fare per ride and per driver so both are closer to rural cities’ averages.

2. Increase both the number of drivers and the fare for ride sharing in rural cities to help increase the availability of ride sharing in these cities as well as the total fares.

3. Increase marketing in the suburban and rural cities to encourage use of ride sharing and ultimately increase the total rides for each city type.
